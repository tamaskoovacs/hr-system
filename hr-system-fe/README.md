# HR System Project

Create a simple UI for an HR system.

You can assume the backend returns JSON in the format provided in the file (an example JSON file is attached).

Following data set will be provided as an array of objects:
Unique Identifier - First Name - Last Name - DOB - Industry - Annual income - other fields

The data can be loaded from a mock server or directly from the /public folder of the application, but should be loaded via a network request.

We would like you to build a small React/Vue application to interact with the provided data set.

The application should have 2 main routes:
●	View provided data which should have the following sub-routes:
○	Display all entries
○	Display one entry
○	Edit one entry
●	View charts regarding the data which can display overall statistics (you will have to do the calculations as part of your javascript code):
○	Average age per industry
○	Average salary per industry
○	Average salary per years of experience
○	Any other statistics you find relevant based on the dataset

Basic validation should be in place for the above operations where required

Emphasis is based on the clarity and quality of the code and the implementation of the functionality outlined below and not on the overall design of the application.
